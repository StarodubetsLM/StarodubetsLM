## Hi, I am Liliia 👋

I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics, with a background in reporting, documentation management, and financial coordination. I am developing expertise in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I am driven to turn data into actionable insights that enhance business performance.

As I continue developing my skills in data analytics, I challenged myself to analyze my own Apple Health data. Using Power BI, I transformed raw health data into interactive dashboards to better understand my activity levels and identify patterns over time.
