I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics, with a background in reporting, documentation management, and financial coordination. I am developing expertise in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I am driven to turn data into actionable insights that enhance business performance.

As I continue developing my skills in data analytics, I challenged myself to analyze my own Apple Health data. Using Power BI, I transformed raw health data into interactive dashboards to better understand my activity levels and identify patterns over time.

## Project Objectives

:red_circle: Analyze overall activity levels (steps, distance, calories burned, etc.)

Identify daily, weekly, and monthly trends

Compare weekday vs. weekend activity

Detect recurring patterns in behavior

Build an interactive dashboard for clear and actionable insights

## Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard development & data modeling

Power Query – XML data transformation and cleaning

DAX – Calculated measures and KPIs

XML (Apple Health export.xml) – Raw data source

## Data Preparation

The Apple Health data was exported in XML format, which required significant preprocessing:

Imported and parsed structured XML data into Power BI

Filtered relevant health metrics (e.g., steps, calories, distance)

Removed unnecessary attributes and duplicate entries

Standardized date and time formats

Created calculated columns (Year, Month, Week, Day of Week)

Developed DAX measures for totals, averages, and trend comparisons

Working with XML strengthened my data transformation and data modeling skills.
