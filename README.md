## Hi, I am Liliia 👋

I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics, with a background in reporting, documentation management, and financial coordination. I am developing expertise in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I am driven to turn data into actionable insights that enhance business performance.

As part of my transition into data analytics, I wanted to work with real-world data that is both meaningful and practical. In this project, I analyzed my personal Apple Health data using Power BI to explore overall activity trends and uncover behavioral patterns.
