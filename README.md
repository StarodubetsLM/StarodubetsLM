I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics, with a background in reporting, documentation management, and financial coordination. I am developing expertise in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I am driven to turn data into actionable insights that enhance business performance.

As I continue developing my skills in data analytics, I challenged myself to analyze my own Apple Health data. Using Power BI, I transformed raw health data into interactive dashboards to better understand my activity levels and identify patterns over time.

## Project Objectives

:black_small_square: Analyze overall activity levels (steps, distance, calories burned, etc.)

:black_small_square: Identify daily, weekly, and monthly trends

:black_small_square: Compare weekday vs. weekend activity

:black_small_square: Detect recurring patterns in behavior

:black_small_square: Build an interactive dashboard for clear and actionable insights

## Tools & Technologies

:black_small_square: Power BI – Dashboard development & data modeling

:black_small_square: Power Query – XML data transformation and cleaning

:black_small_square: DAX – Calculated measures and KPIs

:black_small_square: XML (Apple Health export.xml) – Raw data source

## Data Preparation

The Apple Health data was exported in XML format, which required significant preprocessing:

:black_small_square: Imported and parsed structured XML data into Power BI

:black_small_square: Filtered relevant health metrics (e.g., steps, calories, distance)

:black_small_square: Removed unnecessary attributes and duplicate entries

:black_small_square: Standardized date and time formats

:black_small_square: Created calculated columns (Year, Month, Week, Day of Week)

:black_small_square: Developed DAX measures for totals, averages, and trend comparisons

:black_small_square: Working with XML strengthened my data transformation and data modeling skills.
