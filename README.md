I am a detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics, with a background in reporting, documentation management, and financial coordination. I am developing expertise in Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I am driven to turn data into actionable insights that enhance business performance.

In this project, I analyzed my personal Apple Health data using Power BI to identify overall activity trends and uncover behavioral patterns. The goal was to transform raw health data into meaningful insights that support data-driven lifestyle improvements.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize real-world data using Power BI.
